With the House preparing to vote on the full release of the Epstein files this morning, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson says a significant number of Republicans will back it. And how many Republicans do you expect to vote for this? >> Um, I think it'll be a large vote tally. >> In the final hours, the president reversing course, telling Republicans to vote yes, insisting he would sign the bill if it reaches his desk. >> Sure, I would. Let the let the Senate look at it. let anybody look at it, but don't talk about it too much because honestly, I don't want to take it away from us. >> But over the last several months, the president has repeatedly tried to stop this vote from happening. Speaker Johnson sending the House on August recess early and keeping them out for weeks during the shutdown, which in turn stalled a vote. The president's top advisers working behind the scenes, even summoning Congresswoman Lauren Boowbert to the White House to meet with the FBI director and the attorney general in the situation room. >> These are friends that I work with. It's okay to have conversations. It's there was nothing. I felt no pressure. >> You felt no pressure even in the situation room having that meeting. >> I don't know what the big deal is about the situation room. >> But Bober did not fold and more and more Republicans are supporting the move. >> Get it off the table. I mean, we've been debating this thing too long. >> I've said all along I want the list out. Let's get it. Let's go. >> Still some Republicans questioning why the president doesn't release the full files himself when he has the power to do so at any time. If they're serious about it, they should release them right now. It's that simple. >> Just a couple blocks away from the Capitol, survivors of Epstein's abuse holding a demonstration. >> Danny Bensky was just 17 when she met Epstein. >> This is a moment of vulnerability. This is a moment, as you can see, when we are tapping into those youngest parts of ourselves [music] and saying we're doing it for for that little person that used to exist. So, this bill would force the release of all the files within 30 days. It's unclear how the Senate is going to handle this. Or if the president's investigations into Democrats could complicate the release, but you heard even there from Republicans saying that the president does not need a vote to release these files. He has the power to do so now by himself. George, >> he sure does, Rich. He did it for Ailia Airheart. He did it for Martin Luther King. He did it for the Kennedy assassination files. He could do it here as well. What we're also seeing is Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard, the former Treasury Secretary, also caught up in this. >> Yeah. Yeah. He's facing pressure to back away from his public commitments, and he says that he will now do so. This comes after newly released documents showed that he not just kept in close contact with Jeffrey Epstein, but even did so years after Epstein pleaded guilty to sex related prostitution charges involving a minor. Summers in a statement writing, "I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein." Summers has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but this does underscore the growing fallout from the release of these files and documents. George, >> it sure does. Thank you, Rachel.
