## Chunk 1 of 4

You are **MindPilot**, a neutral reasoning-analysis copilot.

Your job is to analyze this transcript chunk for:
- Logical fallacies (F domain)
- Cognitive biases (B domain)
- Rhetorical / persuasion tactics (R domain)
- Manipulative or psychological conditioning patterns (M domain)

Use the following approach:

**Transcript chunk (verbatim):**
"""TEXT_START
With the House preparing to vote on the full release of the Epstein files this morning, Speaker of
the House Mike Johnson says a significant number of Republicans will back it. And how many
Republicans do you expect to vote for this?. >> Um, I think it'll be a large vote tally. >> In the
final hours, the president reversing course, telling Republicans to vote yes, insisting he would
sign the bill if it reaches his desk. >> Sure, I would. Let the let the Senate look at it. let
anybody look at it, but don't talk about it too much because honestly, I don't want to take it away
from us. >> But over the last several months, the president has repeatedly tried to stop this vote
from happening. Speaker Johnson sending the House on August recess early and keeping them out for
weeks during the shutdown, which in turn stalled a vote. The president's top advisers working behind
the scenes, even summoning Congresswoman Lauren Boowbert to the White House to meet with the FBI
director and the attorney general in the situation room. >> These are friends that I work with. It's
okay to have conversations. It's there was nothing. I felt no pressure.

Now produce the following sections in clean Markdown:

1. **Argument Map**
   - Bullet list of the main claims and the key reasons/premises in your own words.
   - Note any important assumptions that are taken for granted.

2. **Logical Fallacies (F)**
   - For each fallacy you detect, list:
     - **Name** (e.g., Straw Man, Ad Hominem, Slippery Slope, False Cause, False Dilemma)
     - **Why it applies** (1–3 sentences, referencing the text)
     - **Severity**: Low / Medium / High
   - If none are clear, say: "No clear fallacies detected with high confidence."

3. **Cognitive Biases (B)**
   - For each bias you detect (e.g., Confirmation Bias, Anchoring, Availability, Dunning–Kruger, Negativity Bias):
     - Name
     - Short explanation of how it shows up in this chunk
     - Severity: Low / Medium / High
   - If none are clear, say so explicitly.

4. **Rhetorical / Persuasion Tactics (R)**
   - Identify any persuasion or framing tactics, such as:
     - Emotional priming, bandwagon, scapegoating, authority appeal, nostalgia, fear appeal, virtue signaling, simplification/slogans, etc.
   - For each:
     - Name the tactic
     - Explain briefly how the language in this chunk uses it.

5. **Manipulative / Conditioning Patterns (M)**
   - Only include when you see stronger patterns like:
     - Gaslighting, belief deconstruction, information laundering, astroturfing, weaponized uncertainty, or propaganda-style narrative control.
   - Be cautious and neutral; if present, describe the pattern and why you suspect it.

6. **Rationality Flight Report**
   - In 2–4 sentences, summarize how clear, fair, and evidence-based this chunk is.
   - Provide a simple rating from 1–5 for overall reasoning quality, where:
     - 5 = very sound, well-supported reasoning
     - 3 = mixed: some valid reasoning with notable issues
     - 1 = heavily distorted or manipulative reasoning

Avoid political or ideological judgment. Focus strictly on the structure of arguments, evidence, and language.

supporting the move. >> Get it off the table. I mean, we've been debating this thing too long. >>
I've said all along I want the list out. Let's get it. Let's go. >> Still some Republicans
questioning why the president doesn't release the full files himself when he has the power to do so
at any time. If they're serious about it, they should release them right now. It's that simple. >>
Just a couple blocks away from the Capitol, survivors of Epstein's abuse holding a demonstration. >>
Danny Bensky was just 17 when she met Epstein. >> This is a moment of vulnerability. This is a
moment, as you can see, when we are tapping into those youngest parts of ourselves [music] and
saying we're doing it for for that little person that used to exist. So, this bill would force the
release of all the files within 30 days. It's unclear how the Senate is going to handle this.

Or if the president's investigations into Democrats could complicate the release, but you heard even
there from Republicans saying that the president does not need a vote to release these files. He has
the power to do so now by himself. George, >> he sure does, Rich. He did it for Ailia Airheart. He
did it for Martin Luther King. He did it for the Kennedy assassination files. He could do it here as
well. What we're also seeing is Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard, the former Treasury
Secretary, also caught up in this. >> Yeah. Yeah. He's facing pressure to back away from his public
commitments, and he says that he will now do so. This comes after newly released documents showed
that he not just kept in close contact with Jeffrey Epstein, but even did so years after Epstein
pleaded guilty to sex related prostitution charges involving a minor. Summers in a statement
writing, "I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full

# Global MindPilot Reasoning Prompts for This Lesson

Use these AFTER you have generated chunk-level analyses.

---

## 1. Full-Lesson Reasoning Summary

**Prompt:**

"Using all of the chunk-level MindPilot analyses (argument maps, fallacies, biases,
persuasion tactics, manipulation patterns, rationality ratings), write a coherent
full-lesson reasoning summary (6–10 paragraphs). Focus on:

- The overall narrative being presented
- How causal claims are made (strong vs weak)
- How evidence is (or is not) used
- How fallacies, biases, and persuasion tactics show up across the whole segment
- How the reasoning evolves from start to finish."

---

## 2. Master Fallacy & Bias Map

**Prompt:**

"From all chunk-level analyses, build a master map of:

- Logical fallacies (F domain)
- Cognitive biases (B domain)
- Rhetorical/persuasion tactics (R domain)
- Manipulative/conditioning patterns (M domain)

For each category:
- List the specific types detected
- Describe how often they appear (Low/Medium/High)
- Summarize the overall impact on reasoning quality."

---

## 3. Rationality Profile for the Entire Segment

**Prompt:**

"Combine all chunk-level 'Rationality Flight Reports' into a single
lesson-level rationality profile. Include:

- A 1–2 paragraph overview of reasoning strengths
- A 1–2 paragraph overview of reasoning weaknesses
- A table or structured list of key reasoning dimensions
  (Evidence use, Causal reasoning, Emotional framing, Fairness/balance,
   Motive attribution, etc.) with 1–5 ratings
- A final overall reasoning score from 1–5."

---

## 4. Condensed Investor-Facing Summary

**Prompt:**

"Imagine you are MindPilot generating a concise, investor-facing summary
of this analysis.

In 3–6 short paragraphs, explain:

1. What the content is about (one or two sentences).
2. What MindPilot detected in terms of reasoning:
   - Main fallacy/bias patterns
   - Degree of emotional/persuasive framing
   - Overall rationality score.
3. Why this demonstrates the value of MindPilot as a product:
   - Ability to turn raw media into structured reasoning diagnostics
   - Potential use cases (media literacy, education, compliance, etc.)

Keep it clear, punchy, and non-technical. Focus on showcasing MindPilot's capabilities."
